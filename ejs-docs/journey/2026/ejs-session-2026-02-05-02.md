# Problem / Intent

Make the repository immediately understandable to adopters by stating why EJS exists (beyond “Purpose”).

# Interaction Summary (Required)

- Human: Requested a top-of-README explanation of why the project exists.
  - Agent: Proposed and added a concise section capturing the modern-dev + human/AI collaboration motivation and the low-friction artifact model.
  - Outcome: README now has a clear “Why This Exists” section at the top.

# Agent Collaboration Summary

Key prompts used
Key suggestions
Corrections required

# Agent Influence (Required)

- Suggestions adopted:
  - Add a concrete list of what traditional ADRs miss (interaction trail, experiments, pivots, trade-offs).
  - Tie motivation directly to EJS outputs (Journey always, ADR conditional).
- Suggestions rejected (and why):
  - None.
- Human overrides / corrections:
  - None.

# Experiments / Evidence

- Updated README and ensured the new section sits before the “Includes” list.

# Iteration Log

- Added “Why This Exists”.

# Decisions Made

- Decision: Keep the motivation section short and immediately actionable.
  - Reason: Reduce adoption friction; help new users understand the “why” within 30 seconds.
  - Impact: Clearer onboarding.

# Key Learnings

- Motivation is easier to internalize when tied to concrete missing artifacts (interaction + evidence + pivots).

# If Repeating This Work

Do this:
- Put the “why” above the file list.

Avoid this:
- Generic mission statements with no tie to workflow.

Watch out for:
- Over-explaining; keep it skimmable.

# Future Agent Guidance

Prefer:
- Short, concrete bullets.

Avoid:
- Abstract-only framing.

## MACHINE EXTRACTS

### INTERACTION_EXTRACT

- human: "Add a top-of-README section explaining why this exists"
  agent: "Add concise motivation tied to modern dev + human/AI collaboration + low-friction artifacts"
  outcome: "README includes 'Why This Exists' above Includes list"

### DECISIONS_EXTRACT

- decision: "Add 'Why This Exists' section at top"
  rationale: "Improve onboarding and adoption by stating motivation clearly"

### LEARNING_EXTRACT

- learning: "Motivation sticks when linked to missing artifacts (interaction/evidence/pivots)"

### AGENT_GUIDANCE_EXTRACT

- prefer: "Concise motivation tied to concrete workflow"
  avoid: "Generic mission statements"
