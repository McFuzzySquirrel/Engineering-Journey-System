# Problem / Intent

Shift EJS from end-of-session reconstruction to start-of-session initialization with continuous journey updates throughout the session lifecycle.

Based on user feedback from real-world usage in another repository (photo-jumper), continuous documentation updates during multi-step sessions produce far better documentation quality than end-of-session reconstruction from memory.

# Interaction Summary (Required)

- Human: Provided problem statement with example of successful continuous-update approach from photo-jumper repository
  - Agent: Analyzed the request and confirmed it represents a significant architectural shift in EJS workflow
  - Outcome: Understood the need to move from end-of-session to start-of-session with continuous updates

- Human: (Implicit) Expected implementation of the shift
  - Agent: Created implementation plan with checklist covering all EJS artifacts
  - Outcome: Plan established to update agent profile, skill, copilot instructions, README, and create supporting documentation

- Human: (Implicit) Expected thorough implementation
  - Agent: Updated `.github/agents/ejs-journey.agent.md` with three-phase operating mode (initialization, continuous updates, finalization)
  - Outcome: Agent profile now reflects start-of-session initialization and continuous journey updates

- Human: (Implicit) Expected comprehensive coverage
  - Agent: Updated `.github/skills/ejs-session-wrapup/SKILL.md` to handle full session lifecycle (not just wrap-up)
  - Outcome: Skill now manages initialization, continuous updates, and finalization phases

- Human: (Implicit) Expected documentation updates
  - Agent: Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `README.md` to reflect new workflow
  - Outcome: All user-facing documentation now explains three-phase lifecycle

- Human: (Implicit) Expected guidance for agents
  - Agent: Created `ejs-docs/agent-memory/session-lifecycle-patterns.md` with detailed patterns, examples, and anti-patterns
  - Outcome: Comprehensive guide for agents on how to implement continuous-update approach

- Human: (Implicit) Expected decision documentation
  - Agent: Recognized this as a significant process change meeting ADR criteria
  - Outcome: Created ADR 0011 documenting the architectural decision

# Agent Collaboration Summary

**Key prompts used:**
- Problem statement with real-world example showing value of continuous updates
- Implicit expectation of comprehensive implementation across all EJS artifacts

**Key suggestions:**
- Three-phase lifecycle (initialization, continuous updates, finalization)
- Session Lifecycle Patterns documentation for agent guidance
- ADR creation to document this significant process change

**Corrections required:**
- None

# Agent Influence (Required)

**Where did the agent influence the outcome?**

**Suggestions adopted:**
- Three-phase operating mode structure (vs. just adding initialization)
- Comprehensive agent-memory documentation with examples and anti-patterns
- ADR creation to document the architectural decision
- Detailed session lifecycle patterns guide

**Suggestions rejected (and why):**
- None

**Human overrides / corrections:**
- None

# Experiments / Evidence

**What was tried?**
- Updating all EJS artifacts to reflect start-of-session initialization
- Creating comprehensive session lifecycle patterns documentation
- Documenting the architectural decision in an ADR

**What happened?**
- All core EJS files successfully updated with three-phase lifecycle
- Session lifecycle patterns guide created with clear examples and anti-patterns
- ADR 0011 created documenting the decision with full rationale

**What evidence changed your mind?**
- User's real-world example from photo-jumper showed 17 interactions, 4 decisions, 16 iterations accurately captured
- This level of detail would be impossible to reconstruct from memory at session end
- Demonstrates clear value of continuous-update approach

# Iteration Log

1. Created initial implementation plan as checklist
2. Updated agent profile `.github/agents/ejs-journey.agent.md` with three-phase operating mode
3. Encountered Unicode character issues in Session Awareness section, resolved with Python script
4. Updated skill file `.github/skills/ejs-session-wrapup/SKILL.md` for full lifecycle management
5. Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to reflect new workflow
6. Updated README.md with new "How to Use" section and workflow documentation
7. Created `ejs-docs/agent-memory/session-lifecycle-patterns.md` with comprehensive patterns guide
8. Created ADR 0011 to document this architectural decision
9. Created this Session Journey to document the implementation work

# Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Shift EJS to start-of-session initialization with continuous updates
  - **Reason:** Real-world usage demonstrated superior documentation quality from continuous updates vs. end-of-session reconstruction
  - **Impact:** All EJS users will now initialize journeys at session start and update continuously throughout

- **Decision:** Use three-phase lifecycle model (initialization, continuous updates, finalization)
  - **Reason:** Clear phases help agents understand when to take what actions
  - **Impact:** Agent operating modes now map naturally to session lifecycle

- **Decision:** Create comprehensive session lifecycle patterns documentation
  - **Reason:** Agents need clear guidance on implementing continuous-update approach
  - **Impact:** Reduced learning curve, clearer expectations, better adoption

- **Decision:** Create ADR 0011 for this change
  - **Reason:** This is a significant process change affecting all EJS users
  - **Impact:** Decision rationale and trade-offs documented for future reference

# Key Learnings

**Technical insights:**
- Real-time documentation capture is superior to reconstruction from memory
- Three-phase lifecycle (init, update, finalize) maps naturally to agent operating modes
- Incremental file updates tell a continuous story in git history

**Prompting insights:**
- Users naturally signal session start ("let's start", "begin working on")
- Continuous updates should be implicit (automatic) not requiring explicit prompts
- Session boundaries benefit from explicit initialization signals

**Tooling insights:**
- Unicode characters in markdown files require careful handling
- Python scripts are reliable for making complex text replacements
- Session lifecycle patterns documentation is valuable for agent training

# If Repeating This Work

**Do this:**
- Start with clear implementation plan and checklist
- Update all related artifacts together for consistency
- Create comprehensive examples and anti-patterns for guidance
- Document architectural decisions with ADRs when criteria met

**Avoid this:**
- Updating only some artifacts and leaving others inconsistent
- Assuming agents will figure out new patterns without explicit guidance
- Skipping ADR creation for significant process changes

**Watch out for:**
- Unicode characters in markdown requiring special handling
- Ensuring all user-facing documentation is updated consistently
- Providing both human-readable and machine-parsable formats

# Future Agent Guidance

**Prefer:**
- Creating comprehensive agent-memory documentation for new patterns
- Using three-phase lifecycle approach for session management
- Capturing decisions immediately with full context
- Providing concrete examples alongside abstract patterns

**Avoid:**
- Leaving agents to infer new patterns from incomplete documentation
- Updating instructions without updating supporting documentation
- Creating optional patterns when consistent behavior is needed
