# Problem / Intent

Ensure Session Journeys consistently capture the *interaction trail* between human and agent, not just outcomes.

# Interaction Summary (Required)

- Human: Noticed journeys were missing a summary of our interaction.
  - Agent: Proposed updating the canonical journey template and Copilot agent/skill instructions.
  - Outcome: Added an explicit Interaction Summary section and a machine-extractable block.

- Human: Asked to add a machine extract for interaction.
  - Agent: Added `INTERACTION_EXTRACT` under MACHINE EXTRACTS and instructed the wrap-up skill to populate it.
  - Outcome: Interaction is now both human-readable and machine-parsable.

# Agent Collaboration Summary

Key prompts used
Key suggestions
Corrections required

# Agent Influence (Required)

- Suggestions adopted:
  - Add Interaction Summary + guidance to avoid full transcripts.
  - Add MACHINE EXTRACT `INTERACTION_EXTRACT`.
- Suggestions rejected (and why):
  - None.
- Human overrides / corrections:
  - None.

# Experiments / Evidence

- Updated the journey template and verified it contains both the narrative Interaction Summary and the `INTERACTION_EXTRACT` slot.

# Iteration Log

- Added Interaction Summary section.
- Added INTERACTION_EXTRACT block.
- Updated Copilot skill to require population.

# Decisions Made

- Decision: Make interaction capture mandatory in every Session Journey.
  - Reason: The collaboration trail is essential for auditability, learning, and future-agent reuse.
  - Impact: Journeys become reliably useful even when context is lost.

# Key Learnings

- A short prompt/response/outcome trail preserves the “why” without needing full transcripts.

# If Repeating This Work

Do this:
- Add both human-readable and machine-extractable interaction capture.

Avoid this:
- Copying full chat transcripts into the repo.

Watch out for:
- Accidental inclusion of secrets or sensitive content.

# Future Agent Guidance

Prefer:
- Concise chronological interaction summaries.

Avoid:
- Vague collaboration notes without prompts/outcomes.

## MACHINE EXTRACTS

### INTERACTION_EXTRACT

- human: "Noticed journeys were missing a summary of our interaction"
  agent: "Update template + agent/skill instructions to require interaction summary"
  outcome: "Added Interaction Summary section + guidance"

- human: "Add a machine extract for interaction"
  agent: "Add INTERACTION_EXTRACT block and require skill to populate"
  outcome: "Template now supports machine parsing"

### DECISIONS_EXTRACT

- decision: "Require Interaction Summary + INTERACTION_EXTRACT in every journey"
  rationale: "Preserve collaboration trail for auditability and reuse"

### LEARNING_EXTRACT

- learning: "Prompt/response/outcome trail preserves context without full transcripts"

### AGENT_GUIDANCE_EXTRACT

- prefer: "Concise chronological interaction summaries"
  avoid: "Full transcripts; secrets"
