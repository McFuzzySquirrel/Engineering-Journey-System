# Prompt Patterns

A collection of effective prompt patterns for working with AI agents.

## Task Decomposition Pattern

Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps:
```
1. Understand the requirement
2. Explore existing code
3. Plan the changes
4. Implement incrementally
5. Validate each step
```

## Context-First Pattern

Provide context before asking for action:
```
Context: [Describe the situation]
Goal: [What you want to achieve]
Constraints: [Any limitations]
Action: [Specific request]
```

## Example-Driven Pattern

Provide examples to clarify expectations:
```
Task: [Description]
Example Input: [Sample input]
Example Output: [Expected output]
Please apply this pattern to: [Your specific case]
```

## Iterative Refinement Pattern

Start broad, then refine:
```
1. First pass: Get a general solution
2. Review and identify issues
3. Refine with specific feedback
4. Repeat until satisfied
```

## Validation Pattern

Always include validation steps:
```
After making changes:
1. Run tests
2. Check for regressions
3. Verify edge cases
4. Review documentation
```

## Best Practices

- Be specific and clear
- Provide relevant context
- Include examples when possible
- Ask for explanation of reasoning
- Request validation steps
- Iterate based on feedback
